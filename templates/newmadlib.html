    <h1> Thousands of <span>{{num1}}</span> ago, there were calendars that enabled the ancient <span>{{num2}}</span> to divide a year into twelve, each month into <span>{{num3}}</span>, and each week into seven <span>{{num4}}</span>. At first, people told time by sun clock, somethimes known as the <span>{{num5}}</span> dial. Ultimately, they invented the great time keeping devices of today, such as the gandfather, the pocket <span>{{num6}}</span>, the alarm <span>{{num7}}</span>, and, of course, the <span>{{num8}}</span> watch. Children learn about clocks and time almost before they learn the ABCs. They are taught that a day consists of 24 <span>{{num9}}</span>, an hour has 60 <span>{{num10}}</span>, and a minute has 60 <span>{{num11}}</span>. By the time they are in kindergarden, they know if the big <span>{{num12}}</span>is at twelve and the little <span>{{num13}}</span> is at three, and it is o'clock. I wish we could continue this lesson, but we've run out of <span>{{num14}}</span>.</h1>
